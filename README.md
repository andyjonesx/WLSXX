# WLSXX
This is a clone of WLS Wrestling League Simulator by Jamie Winquist released in 1995. 

20 years later and it's still a really fun game, except it doesn't work on Windows 8, and will work less and less as computers move on.

I'm embarking on a quest to clone the game as best as I can, adding a few new features, and making it all open source so it can live on!

For now it is called WLSXX, celebrating the 20th year of the last version WLS.
